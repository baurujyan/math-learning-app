# Math Adventure for Kids

Math Adventure is an interactive web application designed to help kids practice basic arithmetic operations in a fun and engaging way. This project aims to make learning math enjoyable while progressively challenging young learners.

## Features

- **Four Basic Operations**: Practice addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: The difficulty increases as the user solves more problems correctly.
- **Streak Counter**: Keeps track of consecutive correct answers to motivate users.
- **Level System**: Difficulty levels increase as users maintain their streak.
- **Instant Feedback**: Provides immediate feedback on whether the answer is correct or incorrect.
- **Dark Mode**: A toggle for dark mode to reduce eye strain and provide a different visual experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works

1. The app presents a random arithmetic problem to the user.
2. The user inputs their answer and submits it.
3. The app checks the answer and provides immediate feedback.
4. If the answer is correct, the streak increases. If not, the streak resets to zero.
5. Every three correct answers in a row, the difficulty level increases.
6. The problems are generated to ensure that numbers and results never exceed 99, keeping the difficulty manageable for kids.

## Technical Details

- **HTML5**: Structures the content of the web application.
- **CSS3**: Styles the application, including animations and dark mode.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the game logic, problem generation, and user interactions.
- **Local Storage**: Remembers the user's dark mode preference.
